Hi! I'm Jamie, principal scientist and researcher at Research on Knowing. The research results and software we develop are release for free under a MIT license. 

You have my permission to use the free items we develop in your personal, commercial or client projects. All we ask is acknowledgment in the form of 
attribution. The donations we receive make it possible to dedicate more time doing this work. Some people think of the small dollar contributions as buying us a cup of coffee. I don't drink coffee however, but I do drink chai, and the cost is about the same. Just as the caffeine in my chai wakes up my mind, your donations buy time to continue this work.

Thank you so much!
