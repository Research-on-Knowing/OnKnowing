#### About On Knowing

On Knowing is the blog for [Research on Knowing LLC](https://www.researchonknowing.com/). The practical application of epistemology to advance how we learn, understand and create things.

Epistemology within Philosophy is "the theory of knowledge, especially with regard to its methods, validity, and scope. Epistemology is the investigation of what distinguishes justified belief from opinion." (OxfordLanguages) We at Research on Knowing believe the practical application of epistemology can open our eyes and change our point of view. The invention of the telescope changed humanities ideas and understanding of the stars and planets. The microscope made visible an unimagined world within a drop of water. These are examples of how making visible what was previously hidden has revolutionized our knowledge. Computers and software have expanded our knowledge by revealing unseen truths. Research on Knowing employs these kinds of changes in viewpoint to explore how we learn, understand and create things.
