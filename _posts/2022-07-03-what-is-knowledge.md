Many people think very naively about knowing something. Their will state knowlegde is a belief which is true. 
A typical example of something people claim to know is that the sun will rise in the morning. The predictive nature of this statement comes under
immediate attack as failing to be true after a supernova. 

Even when the statement is narrowed to the sun came up this morning, and I know this because I saw it. Many other questions such as where you 
were located come into play. Requiring all knowledge to be the result of personal experience is very limiting. Moreover, the experiments bringing into
question the accuracy of eyewitnesses can shack peoples faith in the ability of anyone to know anything.

Part of the problem lies in requiring knowledge to be always true. Newtonian mechanics made way for the theory of relativity. Yet today Newton's theory is
still taught as knowledge with the caveat that it works except in unusual situations such as moving very close to the speed of light.

The simplest definition of knowledge is a believe with evidence demostrating it is true.
