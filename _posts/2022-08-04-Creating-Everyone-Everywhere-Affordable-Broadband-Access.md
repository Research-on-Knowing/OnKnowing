We produced a paper with recommendations for creating affordable fiber optic
broadband access. Below is the executive summary, and here is the

## Executive Summary

This paper provides essential recommendations for creating affordable fiber optic
broadband access. The current goal for service is 100 Mbps symmetrical (download
and upload speed) at no more than $70/month. By 2032, 1 Gbps should be available
for $100/month. Fiber optic technology should be used and the resulting network
infrastructure should be publicly owned and regulated. Neighborhood networking
projects decompose the larger network allowing the pursuit of a divide and conquer
strategy. Each neighborhood project is driven by local support which can be financed
as Local Utility Districts (LUD), grants, or other funding sources. A menu of private
Internet Service Provider (ISP) companies compete to provide end-user services. Tools
and other considerations that support effective implementation include online network
performance testing and mapping to direct network implementation, cost-benefit
analysis using total cost of operation for decisions such as underground versus aerial
fiber optic installation, and implementation of a dig once policy to accelerate network
backbone growth while saving both time and money. Dig once needs proper incentives
to reward compliance.
