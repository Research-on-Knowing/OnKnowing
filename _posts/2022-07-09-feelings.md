Feelings are very important. Emotional Intelligence (EI) has identified five characteristics as follows:

1. Self Awareness
2. Empathy
3. Motivation
4. Self Regulation
5. Social Skills

Developing these areas is considered essential for personal growth and successful social interaction. EI is “the ability to identify and manage
 one’s own emotions, as well as the emotions of others.” (“Emotional Intelligence,” 2020) The very word emotion denotes what moves a person to take 
 action. The individual is best positioned to access and know their our feelings and emotions.

Using your emotions to reason or think misuses this key human faculty. Expressing your desires and wants is appropriately centered around one's 
feelings. Saying a thing is true because it feels right is nonsense. Developing both emotional and reasoning skills along with applying those skills 
appropriately cultivate a well-balanced mind.
