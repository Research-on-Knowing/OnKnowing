On Knowing is the blog for [Research on Knowing LLC](https://www.researchonknowing.com/). Here you will find articles posted exploring 
the practical application of epistemology to advance how we learn, understand and create things.

Epistemology within Philosophy is "the theory of knowledge, especially with regard to its methods, validity, and scope. 
Epistemology is the investigation of what distinguishes justified belief from opinion." (OxfordLanguages) 
Make sure to read the theory articles first for a basic foundation on our philosophy of knowledge.
Other posts will expand on this foundation diving deeper into the details.

Meanwhile, various other Research on Knowing projects apply our philosophy of knowledge. We at Research on Knowing believe the practical 
application of epistemology can open our eyes and change our point of view. 
The invention of the telescope changed humanities ideas and understanding of the stars and planets. 
The microscope made visible an unimagined world within a drop of water. 
These are examples of how making visible what was previously hidden has revolutionized our knowledge. 
Computers and software have expanded our knowledge by revealing unseen truths. 
Research on Knowing employs these kinds of changes in viewpoint to explore how we learn, understand and create things.

Thank you for joining us on this journey. We hope your discovers here at On Knowing will be enlightening.
