I"s<p>Math stands alone in the discussions of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). 
Other fields of endeavor rely upon mathematics to create models of theories and work products. 
The usefulness of mathematics comes from being inspired by physical reality without relying upon it. 
Like Aristotle described the teachings of Socrates where reality is a shadow of a perfect idealized existence, 
math looks at a system where a few postulates are taken to be true. Assuming a method of logical reasoning, 
mathematicians prove a host of theorems all based on the assumed truth of these postulates or axioms.</p>
