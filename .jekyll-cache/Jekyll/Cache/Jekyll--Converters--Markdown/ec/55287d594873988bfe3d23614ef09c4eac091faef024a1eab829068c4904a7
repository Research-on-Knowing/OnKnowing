I"V<p>Some think knowledge is a belief which is always true. They might say, “I know the sun will come up tomorrow.” 
But, such a statement would prove false in the aftermath of a supernova. We can overcome this difficulty 
by eliminating the prediction and focusing on the present,
saying instead, “The sun came up today.” But did the speaker directly observe the sunrise? 
Or did they figure because the sun is in the sky it must have risen. 
What about days where it is light out, but clouds obscure the sun from view. We assume the sun is behind the clouds without actually seeing it.</p>
