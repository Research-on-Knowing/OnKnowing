I"	<p>In the movie <em>The Matrix</em> (1999) the scene <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVro5wxqh4U">What is Real?</a> has the main character named Neo connected 
to a computer simulation with a terminal jack in the back of his head. Once in the simulation Neo questions the nature of his reality. The 
discussion puts forth a model of human perception where energy signals such as light, sound, heat, and chemicals impinge on the sensory receptors in 
the human body. The receptors react sending impulses through the nervous system to the brain. The brain interprets these impulses constructing a 
mental model creating an individualâ€™s experience of the world around them as what they see, hear, feel, smell, and taste. Our sensory system only 
samples a small amount of the energy fields and chemical molecules present in the environment directly around us. Our brains interpolate to fill any 
gaps where data is missing. The sensory processing system can be thought of as our input from the physical world we live in.</p>
