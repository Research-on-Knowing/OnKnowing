I".<p>Problem-solving can be seen broadly as transitioning a situation from one state to another. This view covers a host of human endeavors. 
Most often the end state is considered a goal or objective. Problem-solving methods can be categorized as either trial and error or 
the use of a recipe. Recipe implies a method with a proven track record for success. Trial and error, however, attempts an approach 
that hasnâ€™t been done successfully. The task of baking oatmeal raisin cookies can be done through trial and error 
where various ingredients are combined. You might expect that through careful experimentation a batch of oatmeal raisin cookies 
that are suitable for consumption might result. But you would also expect in the process to produce several batches of either soggy mush or 
inedible bricks.</p>
