I"¢<p>Religious conservatives have given fundamentalism a bad reputation. ‚ÄúEpistemology of Descartes is known as Fundamentalism. In his book of 
Meditations on First Philosophy, Descartes tries to find some basis of knowledge. He is searching for total certainty, and by doing so, he subjects 
everything to doubt. Through it comes to the only thing he thinks he has the certainty of, his existence.‚Äù (UKEssays, 2018) 
Descartes‚Äô approach has been used to describe mathematical systems and some scientific theories. First principles are adopted as true 
from which everything else is logically proven or demonstrated. Euclidian Geometry is often cited as an example.</p>
